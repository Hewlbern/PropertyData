### Property Analysis

This repo explores data analysis, scraping, visualization that I did for my website Ubiklabs.tech.

It brings together property prices and key features, including but not limited too, the cost of redevelopment and amount of redevelopments possible, the crime rate, the clustering of ethnicities and key venues, schools, and more.

There is more code that was written to create the relevent data tables which are not in this repo. Because they are special and awesome and mine. :D

Venue Combination brings out the venues in a postcode, and clusters them based on features I was optimizing for.

Property Analysis is a compilation, bringing a lot of this analysis and data mining together.

Foursquare API, amongst other API's used, allows for easy data aggregation.

Sneaky Scraper was the first data set i used to test with, i did not use it again. Very nice and open API though :D
